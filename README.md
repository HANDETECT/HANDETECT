# SpiralSense

SpiralSense is an AI-powered web application designed for the early detection and diagnosis of neurological disorders using spiral drawings. This README provides an overview of the project, its features, and instructions for setup and usage.


## Abstract

Neurological disorders have a significant global impact, affecting millions of individuals. Early diagnosis is crucial for improving patient outcomes and enhancing quality of life. However, challenges persist in providing timely and cost-effective diagnosis, especially in resource-constrained environments. Our project, SpiralSense, introduces an innovative solution to address this critical issue. Utilizing machine learning, we have developed a web-based platform accessible worldwide. By leveraging a simple sheet of paper and a pen as diagnostic tools, this application offers an affordable, portable, and non-invasive diagnostic method. It transcends language barriers, reduces patient discomfort, and decreases mortality rates. SpiralSense can simultaneously detect six neurological disorders, including Alzheimer's Disease, Cerebral Palsy, Dystonia, Essential Tremor, Huntington's Disease, and Parkinson's Disease. The diagnostic process is rapid, providing results in just six seconds, with an accuracy rate of 96%, facilitating early intervention and treatment. By alleviating the economic burden of healthcare, this project is particularly well-suited for third-world countries and resource-limited settings, ensuring greater accessibility and patient-centric care. In this era of technological transformation, SpiralSense promises a stress-free, portable, and cost-effective solution for the early detection of neurological disorders.
